Case Study
----------
Next Best Action for Customer Retention and Upselling

1. Context
At XYZ, customer retention and sustainable growth are strategic priorities,
particularly during the renewal phase.
We currently have a churn prediction model in production that identifies
customers with a higher likelihood of churn. While this provides valuable
foresight, prediction alone does not create value. The real impact comes from
deciding what action to take next.
Our focus has therefore shifted to building a Next Best Action (NBA) capability
that enables us to:
• Proactively retain customers at high risk of churn
• Upsell or cross-sell relevant services to suitable customers
• Improve renewal outcomes, revenue, and overall customer experience

This case study reflects a realistic enterprise environment where data is
imperfect, trade-offs are required, and success is defined by business impact,
not technical sophistication alone.

2. Objective of the Exercise
This exercise is designed to assess how you think and operate as a Senior Data
Scientist at XYZ.
Specifically, we are evaluating your ability to:
• Design a sound, end-to-end analytical and modelling-driven solution
• Translate predictive insights into clear retention and upsell actions
• Demonstrate ownership across the full data science lifecycle
(exploration → modelling → evaluation → experimentation)
• Communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical
stakeholders

This is not a coding test. It is an assessment of judgment, structure, and
decision-making.


3. Case Study Components
Component 1: Technical Solutioning
(High-Level | End-to-End Analytical & Modelling View)
This component is technical and should be approached from an analytical and
modelling perspective.
You may assume:
• A churn probability score is available from an existing production model
• Core customer attributes, engagement indicators, and value signals exist
• No dataset is provided; reasonable assumptions are expected and
should be stated clearly
From a data science leadership perspective, outline how you would approach
this problem end to end:

a. Problem Framing and Exploration
• How you would use exploratory analysis to understand customer
behaviour, churn risk patterns, and growth opportunities
• How you would frame the problem to
balance retention and upselling without creating conflicting or
suboptimal actions

b. Analytical and Modelling Approach
• How churn risk, customer value, and engagement signals would be
combined to recommend a Next Best Action
• The types of analytical or modelling approaches you would consider (e.g.
rules, scoring, propensity, uplift, or hybrid) and why
• How the solution differentiates:
o Customers requiring retention-focused actions
o Customers suitable for upselling or cross-selling
o Customers requiring no immediate intervention

c. Evaluation and Experimentation
• How you would evaluate the approach before rollout
• How you would design A/B tests to measure true business impact
• Key metrics for retention, upsell, and customer experience


d. Operationalisation and Learning
• How this solution would be embedded into business workflows (e.g.
CRM, renewal processes)
• How outcomes would feed back into continuous improvement of models
and actions

Coding Expectation (Illustrative)
Include lightweight code or pseudocode to illustrate how analytical logic
translates into action assignment.
The focus is on clarity and structure, not implementation depth.


Deliverables – Component 1
• Technical note or slides: maximum 2 pages or 3–4 slides
• Optional lightweight code or notebook

Component 2: Business Presentation
(Executive Storytelling – Non-Technical)
Prepare a short presentation for senior business stakeholders with no data
science background.

Present the solution as a clear business story, covering:
• The customer challenge in simple terms
• How customers are prioritised for retention vs upselling
• What actions the organisation should take and why
• Expected impact on retention, revenue, and customer experience
• How success will be measured and governed

Guidelines
• No technical jargon or modelling details
• Focus on decisions, outcomes, and value

Deliverables - Component 2
• 4-5 slides, suitable for an executive discussion

4. Time Expectation
The expected effort for this case study is approximately 3–4 hours for a senior
candidate, focusing on clarity of thinking rather than depth of implementation.
Candidates may make reasonable assumptions where information is not
explicitly provided and should state those assumptions clearly.

5. Submission Timeline
Candidates are required to submit both components within one week from
the date this case study is shared.
Submissions received after this timeline may not be considered as part of the
evaluation process.

6. Evaluation Focus
Submissions will be evaluated on:
• End-to-end analytical thinking and ownership
• Soundness of modelling and decision frameworks
• Practicality of retention and upsell logic
• Quality of evaluation and experimentation design
• Clarity and structure of communication
• Evidence of senior-level judgment and leadership mindset

7. Final Note from the XYZ Data Science Team
This case study is intentionally open-ended. At XYZ, senior data scientists
are expected to operate effectively in ambiguity, make informed trade-offs,
and drive decisions that lead to real business outcomes.
We are less interested in which tools you use and more interested in how you
think, prioritise, and communicate.
