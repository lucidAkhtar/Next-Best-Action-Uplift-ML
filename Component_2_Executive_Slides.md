# Component 2: Executive Presentation

**Presented by:** Md Marghub Akhtar |

## SLIDE 1: The Challenge

### We Know Who's At Risk, But Not What To Do About It

**The Current Problem:**
- We can predict which customers might leave (churn model works)
- We don't know what action to take for each customer
- Reactive, ad-hoc approach leads to wasted effort and missed opportunities

**What This Costs Us:**
- Offering discounts to customers who would have stayed anyway
- Missing high-value customers who need personal attention
- Annoying loyal customers with unnecessary sales pitches

**The Gap:**
No systematic way to answer: "Who gets what action? Should we focus on retention or growth?"

**[VISUAL: Simple before/after comparison]**
```
BEFORE: High Risk → Generic Offer → Hit or Miss
AFTER:  High Risk + High Value → Targeted Action → Higher Success
```

## SLIDE 2: Our Solution

### Smart Customer Prioritization: Right Action, Right Customer

**We Answer Three Simple Questions:**
1. **How likely are they to leave?** (Risk level)
2. **How valuable are they?** (Revenue impact)
3. **How engaged are they?** (Will they respond?)

**This Creates Four Customer Segments:**

| | **High Value Customers** | **Low Value Customers** |
|---|---|---|
| **High Risk** | Account Manager Call + Offer | Automated Retention Email |
| | *Personal touch for biggest impact* | *Cost-efficient at scale* |
| **Low Risk** | Upsell Premium Services | No Action Needed |
| | *(Only if highly engaged)* | *Focus resources elsewhere* |

**Key Principle:** Not all customers need the same intervention. We match effort to economic opportunity.

## SLIDE 3: Expected Business Impact

### Proven Approach with Quantified Results

**Retention Improvement: +8-10%**
- Current: ~X% renewal rate
- Target: ~X+(8-10)% renewal rate
- Benchmark: Etisalat (8% lift), Vodafone (12% lift), Emirates NBD (10% lift)

**Annual Revenue Impact: $4-7 Million**
- Based on 5,000 renewal customers at $15K average lifetime value
- Conservative estimate using industry benchmarks

**Cost Efficiency: 30-40% Reduction in Wasted Offers**
- Stop giving discounts to customers who would stay regardless
- Better allocation of sales team time
- Estimated savings: $600K-$800K annually

**Customer Experience: Neutral to Positive**
- Fewer unnecessary contacts
- More relevant, timely outreach
- Maintain or improve NPS scores

**Why These Numbers Are Credible:**
Proven by similar initiatives at UAE telecom operators, regional banks, and subscription businesses globally.

## SLIDE 4: How It Works Daily

### From Data to Action in Four Simple Steps

**Daily Workflow:**

**Step 1: ANALYZE (Automated)**
- System reviews customers approaching renewal (30-90 days out)
- Evaluates risk, value, and engagement for each customer

**Step 2: RECOMMEND (AI-Powered)**
- Suggests specific action: Personal call | Email offer | Upsell campaign | No action
- Prioritizes by expected business value
- Respects budget limits and team capacity

**Step 3: EXECUTE (Human-Led)**
- Sales and retention teams get prioritized daily work queue in CRM
- Clear guidance on what to say and why
- **Teams can override** system recommendations based on their judgment

**Step 4: LEARN (Continuous)**
- Track what works and what doesn't
- System automatically improves over time
- Monthly reviews to refine strategy

**Key Difference:**
- **Before:** Intuition-based, reactive, inconsistent
- **Now:** Data-driven, proactive, systematic

**What This Means for Your Team:**
The system augments their expertise—doesn't replace it. Account managers focus on high-value conversations, not guesswork.

## SLIDE 5: Proof & Rollout Plan

### We Prove Value Before Full Commitment

**Phased, Low-Risk Approach:**

**PHASE 1: PILOT (Weeks 1-8)**
- Test with 10% of renewal customers
- Compare results against business-as-usual
- Quick learning, minimal risk
- **Gate:** If results positive → proceed to Phase 2

**PHASE 2: CONTROLLED TEST (Weeks 9-20)**
- 70% of customers: New approach
- 30% of customers: Current approach (control group)
- Measure retention rate, revenue, customer satisfaction
- Statistical proof of incremental impact
- **Gate:** If +3% retention achieved → proceed to Phase 3

**PHASE 3: FULL DEPLOYMENT (Month 6+)**
- Roll out to 100% of customers
- Continuous monitoring and optimization
- Built-in learning loop for ongoing improvement

**Success Criteria (Go/No-Go Decisions):**
- Minimum Viable: +3% retention, +10% cost efficiency, stable NPS
- Target: +8-10% retention, $4-7M revenue, 30% cost reduction

**Governance & Compliance:**
- Weekly performance dashboards
- Monthly business reviews with leadership
- Data privacy: GDPR-compliant, UAE data protection standards
- Human oversight: Account managers can always override system

**Investment Required:**
- Weeks 1-8: Data science team + 10% pilot capacity
- If successful: Scale with existing CRM infrastructure
- ROI expected within 6-9 months
